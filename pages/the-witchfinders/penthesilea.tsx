                <h2 className="font-bold">CHAPTER 3: Penthesilea</h2>
                <br/>

                <p className="text-left"> She awoke to the sight of Kester keeping watch. He sat at her side with his tail
                    curled neatly over his paws and his ears pricked up, swiveling this way and that to catch the sounds
                    of the early-morning town coming to life around them. She shifted; one ear and then the whole cat
                    turned to face her.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Good morning to you too.&rdquo; She stretched and stood, brushing leaves
                    from her dress.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The town didn&rsquo;t seem quite so intimidating in the light of morning. As they followed the maze
                    of roads past rows of houses with steep roofs and round little windows, Obelie&rsquo;s mind lifted
                    for the first time from the haze of fear she had known for so long. She knew no one here,
                    true &ndash; her courage shrank slightly at the memory of all those people pushing past without even
                    seeming to see her &ndash; but she could rely on herself if she had to, and she had Kester. They
                    would find a way, she decided.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Abruptly, she came to a stop. The richest, smoothest, sweet-savory scent she had
                    ever smelled wound down the street. Her mouth watered. She broke into a run, following it around the
                    corner, past the church and the shops and the crooked alleyways with their strung-up laundry, and
                    found herself outside a narrow storefront with a pink and white striped awning. Kester caught up at
                    her heels, stopping also. Cat and girl stared up at the window together.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The sight that greeted them! Perfect little sugared buns; loaves crammed with
                    raisins and cinnamon and fragrant orange peel; a magnificent vanilla cake on a pedestal, heaps of
                    round red strawberries sinking into the cream, so ripe they glistened. Obelie felt her stomach
                    constrict in a painful knot. It had been a day, she realized, since she had eaten. The cakes and
                    buns wavered in front of her, like a mirage of cool water before a desert traveler. Painted on the
                    glass in neat gold cursive was &ldquo;Pen&rsquo;s Pastries.&rdquo; Tentatively, she pushed open the
                    door. A bell jingled.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The shop was busy. A long line of customers stood in front of her, tall adults who
                    blocked her view of the counter. She shifted impatiently, standing first on one foot, then the
                    other. It seemed she had been waiting a very long time. Her conviction faltered for a
                    moment &mdash;what was she doing here on her own?they would ask, they would turn her
                    away &mdash; but Kester bumped his head reassuringly against her leg and she stood up straighter,
                    determined.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The line moved forward. A nervous-looking woman was at the front of it, speaking
                    in confidential tones to someone behind the counter.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Trouble at home? Let&rsquo;s see what we can do, poor
                    thing&hellip;&rdquo; a friendly voice replied. The woman left a few moments later in a rush of
                    gratitude, carrying a small pink parcel.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The line moved forward again; Obelie was up next, behind a tall man with a
                    briefcase.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have anything for arthritis, do you?&rdquo; he
                    asked. &ldquo;My leg has been terrible in this weather.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Oh dear, I know the feeling all too well,&rdquo; the friendly voice came
                    again. &ldquo;I have just the thing.&rdquo; Obelie saw now that the voice came from a very small old
                    woman in thick-rimmed glasses, her hair cut in a bob below her chin and as white as snow. She
                    disappeared beneath the counter.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Arrayed in the case were rows of bite-sized marzipan packages, painstakingly tiny
                    ribbons and bows drawn on in different colors of icing &mdash; yellow and green and pink and orange.
                    After severalhmmsandahhsshe appeared again, producing a green one and
                    wrapping it neatly in a pink cardboard box secured with twine.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;That ought to help. And put your feet up &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t do to be
                    running around in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, Pen. Thank you.&rdquo; The man paid, tucked the
                    package under his arm, and left whistling. Obelie was next.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Hello ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The old woman didn&rsquo;t see her at first. &ldquo;Hello? Is someone there? Make
                    yourself seen, I have a strict policy against invisible customers.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down here ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; She stood up on her toes. The old
                    woman leaned down over the counter.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Oh, a child. I&rsquo;m sorry, dear &mdash; what can I help you
                    with?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very hungry, ma&rsquo;am. But I don&rsquo;t know if you can help
                    me. I don&rsquo;t have any money,&rdquo; she added apologetically.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Money, hmph!&rdquo; The old woman seemed slightly offended. Adults, Obelie
                    had noticed, often became uncomfortable at the mention of money. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what we can
                    do.&rdquo; She disappeared behind the counter again, and reappeared with a round
                    hand-pie. &ldquo;Ham and spinach,&rdquo; she announced, then added suspiciously, &ldquo;You do eat
                    spinach, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Obelie.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Good. I don&rsquo;t trust anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like spinach &mdash; we
                    must take the bitter in life with the sweet! Now go take a seat in the back and eat that,
                    there&rsquo;s a girl. You can come and find me after.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Obelie did as she was told, and found a long wooden table at the back, in what
                    must have been the kitchen. She eyed with curiosity the mixing bowls and tall racks of metal pans
                    around her, mysterious cakes cooling in them, but decided wisely not to touch anything. She pulled
                    out a chair at the table and sat.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The pie was the most heavenly thing she had ever eaten. It fell apart in her mouth
                    in hot buttery flakes, the layers of crust so thin and crisp they almost shattered. Deep green
                    spinach and bits of caramelized ham were folded inside. She devoured it almost without stopping to
                    breathe, and licked the last crumbs and bits of oil from her fingertips. A transformation had taken
                    place &mdash; not only was she no longer hungry, she had also strangely stopped being tired or cold.
                    Her feet no longer ached, and she felt as if she had just risen from a full night of sleep in a
                    deep, soft bed. She sighed and stretched, filled with the warmth of it, then went back out to the
                    front of the store. Now that she was revived, she had become curious.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;And how are we?&rdquo; the old woman asked kindly.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Much better, thank you,&rdquo; Obelie replied.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The morning crush of customers had slowed to a steady, consistent stream. They
                    would come up to the counter one by one and confide their private problems &mdash; warts, spots, a
                    failed test, an unrequited love &mdash; and the old woman wouldhmmandahhand
                    select from the case some little cake or marzipan figure, packaging it up and sliding it across the
                    counter to the grateful recipient. Each thanked her profusely, and promised to come again. The bell
                    would tinkle as they left, and the old woman would wipe her hands on the raggedy towel tucked over
                    her shoulder, sigh contentedly to herself, and turn to help the next.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> When a lull came in the activity, she would turn and talk to Obelie.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;A pretty name,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And what are you doing in
                    Walton-on-Tye?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Following a cat,&rdquo; Obelie answered honestly.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The old woman looked down at Kester. His keen green eyes stared back at her, and
                    it seemed a certain glance passed between them.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; she replied, as if it were the most natural thing in the
                    world. &ldquo;Do you have somewhere to stay?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Obelie confessed, slightly embarrassed, that she had spent the last night sleeping
                    under a bush. The old womantsked.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;A bush is a fine bed for a cat, but no place for a human girl. You may stay
                    here tonight, if you help out around the shop.&rdquo; And she showed her how to fold the tabs in to
                    assemble the pink cardboard boxes, and tie clever knots with twine. The afternoon passed quickly,
                    and she became very good with the boxes, so that they made an efficient team, the old woman ringing
                    up cakes and buns and tarts at the register while she wrapped them up in neat packages and secured
                    each with a bow. It seemed the whole town came into the little store, with every problem imaginable,
                    and each person left with their burden lightened.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Obelie did not want to seem rude, but she had grown increasingly
                    curious. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, when business slowed again.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I am the witch of the bakery,&rdquo; the old woman replied simply. &ldquo;I
                    am called Penthesilea, although it&rsquo;s a large name for a small enough person. You may call me
                    Pen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I knew she was a witch,&rdquo; Kester said when they were tucked in to
                    sleep in the upstairs window seat. Pen lived above the bakery, and had given them a goose-feather
                    pillow and a thick old quilt, and Obelie found she was quite comfortable, watching the rain fall
                    past the window and into the street below. Kester had curled in a ball on top of the quilt, and was
                    regarding her thoughtfully.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;How could you know?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Cats know these things,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> She contemplated this.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;She seems very kind, helping all these people. Do you think she really is?
                    Can we trust her?&rdquo; She shivered, feeling cold for a moment even here at the memory of the
                    cruel Mr. Maypole.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Kester knew what she meant, and nestled closer under her neck. &ldquo;We can trust
                    her. She&rsquo;s the good kind of witch.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Well then, that settles it. We&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo; She felt her eyelids
                    beginning to fall closed under their weight. &ldquo;Good night Kester.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">  &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; came his reply.</p>

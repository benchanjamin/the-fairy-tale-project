                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">In a land very similar to ours, there was a fairy prince named Pod. Pod
                    belonged to a community of fairies whose work was to harvest cherries off a local cherry tree and
                    put them in a farmer&rsquo;s barrels without him noticing. The fairies were quite proud of their
                    work, and took to it with excitement and dedication. The fairy prince, however, much to the
                    frustration of his parents, had never taken much of an interest in cherry harvesting. When the other
                    fairies of Cherry Fairy Hill flew out in the mornings to carry their cherries over to Farmer
                    Lincoln&rsquo;s barn, Pod the fairy prince snuck in the other direction, deeper into the
                    woods.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">There, amidst the tall trees and cheerful creatures of the woods, Pod would
                    spend the hours of the day eating mushrooms, chasing beetles, and riding snails over fallen logs or
                    overturned stones. Pod enjoyed this very much. However, he did not enjoy what inevitably happened
                    afterwards, when he would fly back in the light of the setting sun, to greet his fellow Cherry
                    Fairies as they returned home to Cherry Fairy Hill.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">All the other fairies would laugh at Pod, or scold Pod, or ignore Pod, or in
                    some other way indicate their annoyance with him for refusing to help out. One especially brawny
                    fairy, Fairy Posy, crossed his arms and scowled at Pod especially angrily.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You are no true Cherry Fairy,&rdquo; he boomed, as everyone else
                    listened on, nodding their heads. Even Pod&rsquo;s parents, King Mod and Queen Fod, only looked on
                    in sad agreement. Fairy Posy&rsquo;s muscular arms were covered in dark red cherry juice, which only
                    made him look more imposing and in the right. &ldquo;A&nbsp;true&nbsp;Cherry Fairy,&rdquo; he
                    growled, &ldquo;a true&nbsp;prince,&nbsp;would get up early with the rest of us, and carry out his
                    rightful responsibility.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; cried the other Cherry Fairies, and Pod&rsquo;s bright
                    acorn-brown face flushed with embarrassment and shame.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">With that, the Cherry Fairies flew away, leaving Pod to his pouting as he
                    floated down to sit forlornly on a mossy tree root. Pod sniffled, and muttered, and shook his fist.
                    But soon he came to his senses, and flew up from his seat, hands on his hips.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a true
                    Cherry Fairy. I am the Cherry Fairy Prince!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The next morning, Pod flew out earlier than even the most dedicated Cherry
                    Fairy. His parents wondered at his empty bed&mdash;dandelion fluff scattered messily on the floor,
                    not at all placed neatly in his walnut shell bed&mdash;but only assumed he&rsquo;d gone to play in
                    the woods again.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">They were correct that Pod was in the woods. However, he was not playing. He
                    was, in fact, attempting to pick a cherry from the Cherry Fairies&rsquo; Cherry Tree. Pod adjusted
                    his grip on one of the cherries&rsquo; green stems. He heaved. He pulled. He yanked. He held on
                    tight, and let his wings stop so that his weight dropped down abruptly.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">But the cherry refused to budge.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod kept pulling. He tried a new tactic&mdash;he held on as tight as he could,
                    and flapped his wings as hard as he could, but still, the cherry didn&rsquo;t move. A bead of sweat
                    broke out on Pod&rsquo;s forehead, and he stopped to catch his breath. &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; he
                    said, starting to worry that maybe he wasn&rsquo;t a true Cherry Fairy after all.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Then inspiration struck! As the morning light filtered through the trees, one
                    cherry released its hold on a nearby branch, and plummeted to the soft ground below. Pod saw it land
                    gently in a pile of newly-fallen leaves.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; he cried, and flew down to the cherry. It was just as
                    shiny as all the others on the tree; it even had one dewdrop balanced on its surface like a jewel.
                    No one would ever know Pod had picked it up off the ground rather than straight from the
                    tree.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Smiling, Pod took hold of the cherry&rsquo;s stem. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he
                    said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; He shut his eyes and fluttered his wings the hardest he had all
                    morning. He could feel the wind coming from his wings, feel it along his cheeks&mdash;he was doing
                    it! He was flying!</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod opened his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The cherry was still firmly on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod sank to the ground, feeling utterly defeated. A tear sprang to his eye. He
                    must be the weakest of all the Cherry Fairies. He could not even lift one single measly
                    cherry!&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Oh snails,&rdquo; sighed Pod, slumping to the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
                    never be a true Cherry Fairy. I&rsquo;m a horrible prince. I think I should resign.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">As he sat with his head in his hands, Pod heard a sassy voice clear its
                    throat. &ldquo;A-hem,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod craned his neck, searching for the speaker, but didn&rsquo;t see any other
                    fairies hanging out by the tree roots.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Behind you, boo-boo!&rdquo; sang the voice.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod was sitting against the cherry. He turned around and gasped. &ldquo;You can
                    talk?!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Of course I can!&rdquo; said the cherry, laughing. She had bright red
                    cheeks and kind eyes. &ldquo;Now what was that rubbish you were saying about not being a good
                    fairy?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod wiped his eyes. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just . . . we&rsquo;re&nbsp;Cherry
                    Fairies,&nbsp;picking cherries is what we do, but I&rsquo;m not even strong enough to pick up one
                    lousy old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Excuse me, I am only one month old!&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; stuttered Pod. &ldquo;But yeah. I&rsquo;m a horrible
                    Cherry Fairy. And&nbsp;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;supposed to be their&nbsp;prince.&nbsp;W-why are you
                    laughing?&rdquo; Pod flew upwards, crossing his arms.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Oh, oh do pardon me,&rdquo; giggled the cherry, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just
                    that, oh&mdash;&rdquo; she dissolved into further giggles.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Pod was starting to feel embarrassed. Even
                    a&nbsp;cherry&nbsp;was laughing at him?</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that&mdash;&rdquo; if the cherry had had arms, she would
                    have been wiping her eyes. &ldquo;I saw you, yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Saw me? Saw me doing what?&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Well, remember, yesterday, when one of those snails you were riding got
                    stuck under a stone? You wedged a twig underneath him and lifted him out, even though the snail was
                    definitely&nbsp;much&nbsp;heavier than I am. You used your smarts to solve a problem and help out
                    your friend.&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod thought about it. He hadn&rsquo;t even realized what he was doing. He just
                    saw a twig, had an idea, and thought it might help free the snail. And it had! But . . .&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But I still can&rsquo;t pick, or lift,&nbsp;or&nbsp;carry a
                    cherry,&rdquo; protested Pod, &ldquo;what good is it that I could help a snail?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No silly,&rdquo; laughed the cherry, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about
                    the&nbsp;snail. You&rsquo;re good at solving problems! I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way you could
                    use that brain of yours to help the Cherry Fairies&mdash;you can be a good Cherry Fairy just the way
                    you are.&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod frowned. He thought about it. And slowly, a light began to rise in his
                    face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he cried. He darted about in the air, like he wasn&rsquo;t
                    sure where to fly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need lots of bendy roots, and flat pieces of bark, and maybe
                    even some mushroom tops! Oh&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, and flew back to the fallen
                    cherry. &ldquo;Thank you! You&rsquo;ve given me a great idea.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; called the cherry, as Pod flew off into the
                    trees, &ldquo;and remember&mdash;you&rsquo;re perfect just the way you are!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The pretty buzzing sound of Pod&rsquo;s wings faded into silence. The cherry
                    looked around her surroundings. There was a leaf next to her on the ground. &ldquo;Well,
                    Leafy,&rdquo; said the cherry, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s just you and me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The leaf made no response.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">A week later, when the fairies of Cherry Hill gathered on the thickest branch
                    of Cherry Tree to begin that day&rsquo;s harvest, they were surprised to find their prince waiting
                    for them.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Greetings my fellow fairies,&rdquo; said Pod, bowing low to the confused
                    crowd, &ldquo;I have something to show you.&rdquo; He caught the eye of Fairy Posy, who was looking
                    especially brawny and bewildered, and smiled.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Introducing . . . the Cherry-Carry Three-Thousand!&rdquo; exclaimed Pod,
                    pulling a leaf-blanket off a contraption of bark and twigs, spider web and woven grass. &ldquo;CC3
                    for short.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What does three-thousand mean?&rdquo; whispered Fairy Posy to one of his
                    friends. The friend shrugged.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The Cherry-Carry3000 was essentially a woven crate with a solid bottom of bark
                    and four hoops at each corner of the top of the open crate. The twigs that interlaced to make up its
                    walls were tied together with long strings of spider web that glistened in the morning
                    light.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What are those hoops for?&rdquo; asked a short fairy.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you asked, Fairy Juniper,&rdquo; said Pod. He took a long
                    strip of braided grass and threaded it through one of the hoops. &ldquo;You tie it, like this, and
                    then&mdash;&rdquo; he tied the other end of the rope around his small waist. &ldquo;By using these
                    ropes, four fairies can fill the CC3 with as many cherries as they can&mdash;it holds up to&nbsp;ten
                    cherries,&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t tried more yet&mdash;and together they can bring more cherries at a
                    time than ever to Farmer Lincoln&rsquo;s!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">The crowd gasped, oohed and awed. Four fairies quickly flew over, taking
                    Pod&rsquo;s place, to try out the new contraption. The rest of the crowd plucked cherries and piled
                    them high. Pod stepped back, fluttering his wings in nerves and anticipation. The four fairies
                    flapped their wings, straining against the weight of the CC3, and then&nbsp;thirteen&nbsp;cherries
                    were airborne!&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; cried the crowd, &ldquo;hooray! Hooray for Prince
                    Pod!&rdquo; Pod blushed with pride.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">As the four fairies flew away, the rest of the crowd went to their work with
                    renewed energy. Pod felt a strong hand clap his shoulder. It was Fairy Posy, grinning from ear to
                    ear. &ldquo;This is amazing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an invention like this will revolutionize the
                    cherry-picking game! Think of how much time we&rsquo;ll save . . .&rdquo; A dreamy look came into
                    his eye. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll finally have time to pursue my dream&mdash;baking! I&rsquo;d bake
                    cherry pies, cherry cupcakes, cherry strudel, cherry cookies . . .&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">From far below, Pod thought he heard a familiarly sassy voice cry
                    out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod laughed nervously. &ldquo;Um, that sounds great Fairy Posy, but maybe you
                    can start with&nbsp;mushroom&nbsp;baked goods instead&mdash;after all, Farmer Lincoln does need our
                    cherries.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Fairy Posy nodded solemnly. &ldquo;Prince, you are absolutely right. Mushrooms
                    have more of a sweetness to them anyway.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Pod bit back a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Make sure to build lots more CC3s!&rdquo; cried Fairy Posy, before
                    flying away to help with the harvesting.&nbsp;</p>

                <p className="text-left">Pod stood on the branch, watching his people work, and finally felt like he had
                    found his place. By the next spring, Pod had made more than enough CC3s for the fairies of Cherry
                    Hill, and had the opportunity to branch out and help their neighbors&mdash;the fairies of Orange
                    Hill. Pod found that oranges were much bigger and heavier than cherries, but he no longer feared a
                    challenge, for he always remembered the fallen cherry&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Behind you,
                    boo-boo!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p className="text-left"><br/></p>
                <p className="text-left">Well, no, not&nbsp;those&nbsp;words. These ones. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfect
                    just the way you are.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

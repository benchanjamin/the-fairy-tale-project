                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Being in the car, Ruby&rsquo;s trailer bumping along behind us, was such a
                    familiar feeling that I
                    almost felt like things were normal. But Morv sat with hunched shoulders like a huge shriveled bird,
                    and I was in the driver&rsquo;s seat without Mom quietly correcting me even when I knew my driving
                    was not quite right. Even when I knew that probably, my eyes weren&rsquo;t even good enough to
                    drive, anyway. Realizing this, and also remembering that Morv&rsquo;s eyes were superhumanly good, I
                    asked as nonchalantly as I could: &ldquo;Would you mind letting me know&mdash;if it looks
                    like&mdash;by any chance&mdash;that I&rsquo;m about to hit something?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Morv said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Including from behind?&rdquo; I added quickly.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;And the sides?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Morv reached over and pulled off my glasses.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;WOAH!&rdquo; I shouted. I swerved on instinct, or out of terror, and
                    thank God I knew there
                    was no one on the road, because I couldn&rsquo;t see anything and my hands trembled just to keep the
                    wheel still.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Morv snapped. &ldquo;Keep
                    driving.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see!&rdquo; I said, my voice shrill. &ldquo;Give me back
                    my glasses!&rdquo; I
                    released one hand from the wheel, holding it out.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you can&rsquo;t really see.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Well, this isnotthe time to test me!&rdquo; I said, my voice somehow
                    even higher and
                    squeakier.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Just look ahead,&rdquo; Morv said, seemingly unconcerned that the car
                    was being driven by an
                    essentially blind driver who was just trying to keep straight without any clue as to whether we were
                    even still on the road beyond the fact that the road&rsquo;s textureseemedunchanged.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; I said again, hoping the desperation in my voice was as
                    obvious to Morv as it
                    was to me. &ldquo;We can play this game some other time! I&rsquo;m going to get pulled over for
                    drunk driving!&rdquo; I squinted, trying to make out the shapes ahead of me. Was one of them a car?
                    It could definitely be a car.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Worst of all, though, no matter what it was, I couldn&rsquo;t quite tell
                    exactlywhereit was. It moved
                    slowly left-to-right like the profile of a child on a swing, sadly and sleepily pushing themself
                    back and forth, back and forth&hellip;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Just unfocus your eyes,&rdquo; Morv
                    said. &ldquo;Stopsquinting.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I was desperate enough that I tried. I let my gaze relax even as my hands
                    gripped the steering wheel
                    tighter. Still the shapes in front of me swayed. Still the distinction between the road and its
                    border were completely unclear, even the lines&mdash;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> The large something zipped past, far too close to us, but it gave me a sense
                    of where the double
                    yellow line must be. I pulled off to the right, slowing down, and felt the texture of the road
                    change beneath us. I parked the car.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I turned to Morv, who, being so close to me, looked quite clear, even though I
                    saw their face as
                    two, my eyes working independently. But it was just like when we&rsquo;d talked in the dark in the
                    bathroom at Lowe&rsquo;s: I didn&rsquo;t need to see them to glare at them.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to see you try.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;It would be easy,&rdquo; I spat. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;d have to do is get
                    back on the road.
                    I&rsquo;d get us into a crash in no time. I thoughtyouwere supposed to keepmesafe! Instead
                    you&rsquo;re setting me up to die!&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Morv didn&rsquo;t look even a little bit abashed. &ldquo;I thought the energy
                    of the moment might
                    get you to start thinking differently.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;What does that evenmean? What if I&rsquo;d had a panic attack? What if
                    I&rsquo;d passed out
                    from fear?&rdquo; I knew I was getting a little dramatic, but Morv&rsquo;s completely unconcerned
                    expression was beginning to make me mad.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve driven the car. It would&rsquo;ve been
                    fine.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I thought you can&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stupid. I could figure it out.&rdquo;
                    <br/> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stupid,
                    you&rsquo;re just arrogant. Driving isnoteasy.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I have other skills you don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I crossed my arms. &ldquo;Care to share, before you get me into another
                    life-threatening situation?
                    Or care to give me my glasses back?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Morv slowly handed over my glasses, and then reached under their seat, pulling
                    out the jar of
                    rubies. &ldquo;Have one.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Your eyes. And your fear.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Myfear?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;And when you&rsquo;re not driving, I want you to keep your glasses off.
                    Understand? Your eyes
                    need to start working for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I took the ruby and swallowed it. Even though every fiber of my body wanted to
                    slap Morv and not
                    listen to another word they said, I also, on some level I didn&rsquo;t want to admit, trusted them.
                    I actually trusted them a lot. I was embarrassed to admit it, even to myself, but it was true. Even
                    after what had just happened.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Maybe it was because I had no else left to trust.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> And then I remembered why I&rsquo;d picked Disney World as our populated
                    destination&mdash;after
                    all, Coney Island was way closer and still had plenty of people. And wasn&rsquo;t there a Six Flags
                    in New Jersey?</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> But I had another reason for wanting to go to Florida&mdash;to gobackto
                    Florida. To drive over a
                    thousand miles.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Lola. I had no one left but Lola.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I felt the ruby sliding down my throat. I felt warm inside, like a small spark
                    had been lit,
                    flashed, and then died within me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Morv handed me my glasses. With as much contempt as I could communicate, I
                    cleaned them with the hem
                    of my hoodie and placed them on my face.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Then I reached into the glovebox and pulled out my east coast map&mdash;Mom
                    and I had one map per
                    region of the US, plus maps for each state. Sometimes they were out of date and we ended up on roads
                    that were no longer roads, but they usually got the job done. And anyway, we weren&rsquo;t ever
                    really going to such specific places, at least not on our long drives. We were always just
                    gettingaway. From what exactly, I had never really wondered.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Now I wondered.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I felt Morv&rsquo;s eyes on my neck as I searched the map, finally locating
                    the US 1, and figuring
                    out how I could get there from Schenectady. I&rsquo;d have to get to northern New Jersey to merge
                    onto it; then I could follow it all the way down and not need to check a map again until we were a
                    few miles off from the town Lola&mdash;I hoped&mdash;still lived in.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">And then maybe we could park at her house for the night. And her parents would
                    cook us dinner. And we
                    could go to Disney World the next day but come back every night to her house.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I wondered if that was really possible. I had to believe it was.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Once again I felt as though I either had nothing or everything to lose.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> Morv said nothing as I folded up the maps, tucked them back in the glove-box,
                    and pulled back out
                    onto the road. I found my hands still shaking on the wheel, but at least I could now see.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> For the next half hour we were completely silent. And then I said, &ldquo;Are
                    you testing me? Is
                    this a test?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I saw Morv frowning in the rearview mirror. &ldquo;No. Why would I do
                    that?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m just trying to think ofsome reasonwhy
                    you&rsquo;d&mdash;do
                    that.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I told you. I thought it would&mdash;snap your
                    vision to normal. You know.
                    The life-or-death motivation. I have no reason to lie to you.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Yeah. And I have no reason to trust you.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;But you do.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;The life-or-death motivation is a proven theory. I learned it from one
                    of my
                    parents.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Who learned it from&hellip; a psychology journal?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;No. Oral literature. Like everything else.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Just a story someone told?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not what oral literature is.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Doesn&rsquo;t
                    sound&hellip; peer-reviewed.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Of course it is. You say it aloud and everyone debates it real-time.
                    And it&rsquo;s so easy
                    to update with a retelling, once you&rsquo;ve gotten new information.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;And how do you know someone doesn&rsquo;t update it falsely?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Same goes for written literature. There&rsquo;s no
                    difference.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Of course there is. You could mess it up by accident. Mistake of
                    memory.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re dragons.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;I know we&rsquo;re dragons, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Tell me. Have you ever forgotten a single story your mother has ever
                    told you?&rdquo;</p>

                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;How did you know my mother tells me stories?&rdquo;</p>

                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Well, the answer is yes. Of course I&rsquo;ve forgotten
                    things.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;What have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Well, sometimes I wasn&rsquo;t even paying attention when she told me
                    stories.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different problem. Let&rsquo;s say you were paying

                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story my mother told me
                    where I think there must
                    be an ending but I can&rsquo;t recall it.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> &ldquo;Tell me the story.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left"> I took a deep breath.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;In a city without a name, there was a dragon without a face. He
                    wasn&rsquo;t liked by the
                    other dragons, but only because he didn&rsquo;t have a face. It was like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv interrupted me. &ldquo;&mdash;his nose and his mouth were one.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I glanced at them in surprise, before quickly turning my eyes back on the
                    road. &ldquo;How did you
                    know that?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic. My parents told me it too.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Butthe exact words my mother said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not justherstory. It&rsquo;sourstory.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I couldn&rsquo;t think how else to prove that statement other than continue,
                    even though I
                    didn&rsquo;t want to. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have eyes. He navigated via smell&mdash;he had a really
                    good sense of smell. But for a dragon, he was still clumsy. Dragons are graceful. This dragon was
                    not.&rdquo; I paused, waiting for Morv to continue.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But for what he lacked in grace, he made up for in kindness. He was the
                    kind of dragon who did
                    things for other dragons. He found flying easier than walking, like most dragons, but for him
                    walking was such a struggle that flying seemed glorious. He would fly around and find things for
                    other dragons, like things they had lost, or things which had been stolen from them. He would return
                    these things to their rightful owners.&rdquo; Morv paused. &ldquo;Do you believe me now?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I continued in a rush; once having begun, I knew we couldn&rsquo;t
                    stop. &ldquo;For this he was
                    well-liked&mdash;no, he wasessentialto the dragon community. He was willing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv cut me off. &ldquo;&mdash;to go places other dragons would not dare. He
                    had a sense of justice.
                    Other dragons thought smilingly of him. They relied on him. They called upon him when they needed
                    him, whether it was his grace in the sky or the grace in his heart.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Feeling numb, I continued. &ldquo;But this dragon was not loved. And it was
                    because he was hard to
                    look at. It is hard to love someone whom it is hard to look at. Dragons would see him and want to
                    look away. His voice was also hard to listen to, because it sounded strange to the dragons, closer
                    to a human voice than a dragon voice. There was nothing the dragon could do about his
                    voice.&rdquo; I stopped, taking a breath. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I remember. After
                    that it&rsquo;s just a blank.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not ended?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a blank. That&rsquo;s the end of the story.
                    There&rsquo;s nothing else to
                    it.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">
                    &ldquo;What do you mean, why?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">
                    &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no moral?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">
                    Sometimes it&rsquo;s just life.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">That last comment annoyed me; wasn&rsquo;t I alive? Didn&rsquo;t I live a life
                    strange enough, and at
                    times hard enough, to constitutereal life? Especially for a fifteen-year-old, Morv acted like they
                    wereoldold. And it had only taken five days for this to annoy me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;So, do you believe me now?&rdquo; Morv asked. &ldquo;That dragon memory,
                    and oral literature,
                    are real and essential andprofoundly important to our culture and its historical
                    resonance?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yeah, you didn&rsquo;t make that up.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv frowned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I did.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Parrot.&rdquo; I stuck my tongue out at them.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv turned away from me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Five days and I wanted to kill them.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">And now we were driving to Florida.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I had to keep Lola front and center in my mind; otherwise I wasn&rsquo;t sure
                    if I&rsquo;d be able to
                    do it.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What are you thinking about now?&rdquo; Morv asked sharply. &ldquo;You
                    started smiling. It
                    makes me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;None of your business.&rdquo; I reached out and turned on the
                    radio. &ldquo;We need
                    music.&rdquo;</p>

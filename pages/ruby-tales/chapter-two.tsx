                <h2 className="font-bold">CHAPTER 2</h2>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">We had &ldquo;the talk&rdquo; when I was in third grade.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Mom was driving; we had packed up and left Albuquerque after four weeks, once
                    again not long enough for me to make a real friend, but long enough to know what kids were like.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You probably know you&rsquo;re different,&rdquo; was how Mom began
                    things.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you many stories. You&rsquo;re very clever.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">This was the kind of thing Mom was always telling me. That I was smart and that
                    her stories were important. I didn&rsquo;t doubt it. I loved her stories, and like any
                    eight-year-old, I didn&rsquo;t have many reasons to doubt my intelligence, at least not yet.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But this story is&nbsp;especially&nbsp;important. Because it&rsquo;s
                    about you. I mean us.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; I feigned coolness, but I was rapt with attention. I
                    scrunched up my already long legs in the shotgun seat and leaned to the left to hear Mom a little
                    better. As always, when she was telling me something important, her voice became slightly
                    quieter.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dragon.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I knew this already, as well as I knew it was a secret. Mom had told me I was a
                    dragon, not a human, so long ago that I could no longer remember. And she hadn&rsquo;t just told me
                    once, she&rsquo;d told me again, and again, and again. So I knew more was coming.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;There will be changes in your body. Big changes.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to grow wings, and claws, and you&rsquo;re not going
                    to become more boy or more girl. You&rsquo;ll still be dragon, fully.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I liked that; I liked that wherever I went, I could decide to be a boy or a
                    girl, and then it was so. I didn&rsquo;t know how Mom had become a woman, or if it was just that
                    she&rsquo;d decided to always be one. But I knew I was a dragon and that sex did not apply to
                    me&mdash;that was a thing humans dealt with. Gender never needed to be a concern of mine.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The part that struck me was the wings part, and the claws part. It would be
                    harder to fit in&mdash;even harder than it was already&mdash;if I had those. I didn&rsquo;t know any
                    human kids with wings or claws.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to choose,&rdquo; Mom said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Because.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Will my wings be small like yours? Or big like the ones in the
                    stories?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Mom frowned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be bigger than mine.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why do you have little wings?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Because.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t like&nbsp;because.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And your claws will be bigger than mine too.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;How will I keep them a secret?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You can cut them, like fingernails.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s hoodies you can get. That hide wings. You can fold
                    them up. Just like me.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But yours are small.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Again, Mom frowned. &ldquo;I know. Let me get to the story.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I had forgotten that a story had been promised. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Mom put on the indicator. We were getting off the highway. I didn&rsquo;t know
                    where we were. I didn&rsquo;t know where we were going. I&rsquo;d been desensitized to travel: it
                    didn&rsquo;t matter to me where we went, how long we stayed, or where or what the weather was or any
                    of it.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">All I did was listen to Mom&rsquo;s story, and I always listened hard.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">In a city without a name, there was a dragon without a face. He wasn&rsquo;t
                    liked by the other dragons, but only because he didn&rsquo;t have a face. It was like his nose and
                    his mouth were one. He didn&rsquo;t have eyes. He navigated via smell&mdash;he had a really good
                    sense of smell. But for a dragon, he was still clumsy. Dragons are graceful. This dragon was
                    not.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But for what he lacked in grace, he made up for in kindness. He was the kind of
                    dragon who did things for other dragons. He found flying easier than walking, like most dragons, but
                    for him walking was such a struggle that flying seemed glorious. He would fly around and find things
                    for other dragons, like things they had lost, or things which had been stolen from them. He would
                    return these things to their rightful owners.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">For this he was well-liked&mdash;no, he was&nbsp;essential&nbsp;to the dragon
                    community. He was willing to go places other dragons would not dare. He had a sense of justice.
                    Other dragons thought smilingly of him. They relied on him. They called upon him when they needed
                    him, whether it was his grace in the sky or the grace in his heart.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But this dragon was not loved. And it was because he was hard to look at. It is
                    hard to love someone whom it is hard to look at. Dragons would see him and want to look away. His
                    voice was also hard to listen to, because it sounded strange to the dragons, closer to a human voice
                    than a dragon voice. There was nothing the dragon could do about his voice.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The strange dragon released me, and we faced each other in the parking lot. I
                    realized all of a sudden that the dragon facing me wasn&rsquo;t old&mdash;in fact, we could be the
                    same age. But the moment I had processed this information, I crossed into terror. Mom was gone. What
                    could this dragon do to me&mdash;where was Mom&mdash;and were there&nbsp;others? Other dragons?</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; the dragon said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt
                    you.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But my mom!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not up to me.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Then what are you here for?&rdquo; I stepped back. The dragon just
                    stared at me. &ldquo;Why are&nbsp;we&nbsp;here?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo; The look in their eyes seemed
                    legitimately apologetic, but I didn&rsquo;t know what to think. I wanted to hit
                    something&mdash;break something&mdash;but we were just in this empty parking lot on this
                    empty-feeling evening. And I knew that if it came to a fight, I wouldn&rsquo;t win.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Instead I asked, &ldquo;Do you have a name?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dragon smiled. Their expression was like a human smile, but somehow
                    off. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I noticed a thin line of scales on their wrist, which were colored blue, black,
                    and green&mdash;but from another angle, colored white like a long scar.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">They glanced around as though we were being watched. &ldquo;We should go
                    inside.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Inside Ruby, seated on the bench at our glued-in-place table, I asked the
                    dragon to tell me more.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&nbsp;&ldquo;My name is Morv. And I know your name, Aeon.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I wanted to ask why, and how, but I couldn&rsquo;t look away from the
                    dragon&rsquo;s eyes. I just wanted to hear them say more&mdash;to tell me what was going on, and
                    where my mother was.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You must know something,&rdquo; I tried, my tone as polite as I could
                    make it.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only&mdash;only seventeen. I&rsquo;m not supposed to tell you
                    anything. I&rsquo;ve only grown a few scales. I&rsquo;m just doing what I&rsquo;ve been
                    told.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;How? I mean, how did you grow scales?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dragon looked pitying but did not answer the question.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s listening to us?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Okay. So then why can&rsquo;t you tell me what you know?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And.&rdquo; The dragon crossed their arms. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
                    everything that&rsquo;s been going on. That is. That brought me here.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t tell me what brought you here.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">
                    &ldquo;Even though no one&rsquo;s listening to us.
                    Apparently.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Because then I&rsquo;d have to kill you,&rdquo; Morv said
                    apologetically.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And&nbsp;you&rsquo;re&nbsp;only thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;How long are you going to be here? Because&mdash;&rdquo; I hesitated.
                    Would it be a lie to say I couldn&rsquo;t live without Mom? &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t
                    drive,&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I lied. &ldquo;And this is, well, this is an RV.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv bit their lip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an RV.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I meant what I said. I&rsquo;m staying&mdash;a while.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;To watch you.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&nbsp;seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&nbsp;thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yes, but why&nbsp;you?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m who they could spare.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And who are they?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv crossed their arms again before immediately uncrossing
                    them. &ldquo;I&mdash;well. I guess I can tell you this much. But not yet.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">They glanced out the window. I didn&rsquo;t believe that we weren&rsquo;t being
                    listened to, or watched; a hunted look colored their eyes and yet there was only me, a silly little
                    thirteen-year-old&mdash;well, a silly&nbsp;tall&nbsp;thirteen-year-old, but still a good four inches
                    shorter than Morv.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; they said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I stood when Morv stood and we looked at each other.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Am I short for a dragon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re average.&rdquo; Morv looked away.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;To get dinner.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Taco Bell across the highway.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv did not respond, and I stumbled after them out of the door, locking Ruby
                    behind myself.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Can you fly?&rdquo; Morv asked me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No. Should&mdash;should I be able to?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. How do you go places? Other than driving. That
                    wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I bike,&rdquo; I said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Morv sounded skeptical.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Do you know how to ride a bike?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&nbsp;should&nbsp;be able to. Come on. You&rsquo;re
                    seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Under the streetlamps illuminating the parking lot, their face seemed somehow
                    gaunt and young at the same time. They shrugged. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Where are we going? We don&rsquo;t need to bike to Taco Bell.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No. We&rsquo;re going to have real dinner.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Panera Bread?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Dragon dinner.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv looked far too serious. &ldquo;Okay. And that is?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had it before?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know whether to wear that fact like a badge of
                    honor or a dunce cap. I tried to look a little taller and bigger than I was, but it was hard; not
                    only was Morv taller than me, but they were wider, like they had a lot of muscles under their
                    cloak. &ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;That explains why you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo; Morv cut off.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Not able to fly?&rdquo; I suggested, cheeks burning. That morning I
                    hadn&rsquo;t even known dragons could fly, apart from in stories. But stories were not always quite
                    real.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;That kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Then what do we do?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to let you out of my sight,&rdquo; Morv said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Can we ride your bike at the same
                    time?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I guess? If you can balance?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv looked at me like there was no way I could be stupider. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
                    a&nbsp;dragon.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Me too, though, and I can&rsquo;t even do a balance beam for five seconds, I
                    almost said, but I didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want to seem stupider. Even though I wasn&rsquo;t
                    the one who didn&rsquo;t know how to ride a bike.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Then come on.&rdquo;</p>

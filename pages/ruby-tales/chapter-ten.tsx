                <p className="text-left">I followed Cindy to the cash register. She jumped when she realized I was
                    behind her, but then smiled
                    and said, &ldquo;Need anything, hon?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I just looked at the cashier. &ldquo;May I use the bathroom?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Code&rsquo;s 1-5-4-2.&rdquo; Cindy paid for her coffee and we both
                    walked
                    to the bathroom. I saw her looking at me, glancing at the bathroom doors. I decided because
                    I&rsquo;d gone with Alex as my name, the men&rsquo;s room made more sense. And that way I
                    wouldn&rsquo;t risk Cindy trying to chat with me while we were pissing&mdash;for all her politeness,
                    that seemed like something she might do.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">We went our separate ways and met back at the car. Morv was standing, waiting
                    for
                    us, blinking in the dim twilight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep on the roof,&rdquo; they said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if they had slept the whole time they&rsquo;d been with me,
                    and I also wasn&rsquo;t sure that they weren&rsquo;t going to do something other than sleep on the
                    roof. So I just nodded at this as though it was typical. &ldquo;You can take the bed or the couch or
                    the front seats of the car,&rdquo; I told Cindy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your preference. You know, with
                    the baby.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">She smiled at me. &ldquo;I think the couch will be alright.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I nodded and opened the trailer. She got in and I closed the door behind her,
                    giving her some privacy&mdash;and because I wanted to talk to Morv. Or, maybe I didn&rsquo;t want
                    to, but Morv looked like they wanted to talk to me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">We moved a little ways away from Ruby.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a good feeling about this one,&rdquo; Morv said to me
                    the moment we were out of earshot. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something not right. I can&rsquo;t believe
                    you did that, let a stranger into our space!&rdquo; </p>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;She seems nice.
                    More than nice. I&rsquo;m happy to give someone a ride, it&rsquo;s no skin off my back. And
                    she&rsquo;s&nbsp;pregnant. You can&rsquo;t leave a pregnant woman on the side of the road.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yes, about that,&rdquo; Morv said, brow furrowed. &ldquo;How did you
                    know?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What do you mean, how did I know?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;How did you know she was pregnant? I heard you go, &lsquo;with the
                    baby.&rsquo; I connected the dots, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Morv,&rdquo; I said, trying not to laugh, &ldquo;have you really never
                    spent time around
                    humans? Why do you think her belly&rsquo;s like that?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I figured that was just&hellip; how she was.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Perfectly round like she&rsquo;s hiding a beach ball under her
                    shirt?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Maybe she is hiding a beach ball under her shirt&hellip; &rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;No, Morv, she&rsquo;s&nbsp;not. She&rsquo;s obviously pregnant and
                    obviously pretty far along.
                    I should ask her how many months she has left.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very smart,&rdquo; I said to
                    Morv, &ldquo;and older, and wiser. But sometimes I&nbsp;do&nbsp;know more than you. Especially about
                    humans. I&rsquo;ve lived among them my whole life.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Speaking of which.&rdquo; Morv reached into a pocket and pulled out a
                    ruby. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I swallowed it. It was cool water sliding down my throat. &ldquo;When am I
                    going to start noticing
                    the effects of these? More than just feeling like they&rsquo;re food?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t noticing them?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I feel normal. I don&rsquo;t feel hungry if I take one. I still go to
                    the bathroom, though,
                    just as much as normal. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t feel like anything&rsquo;s
                    changed.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Morv said. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s not a bad
                    sign.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What do you mean? What would be a bad sign?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d know if there was a bad sign.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;What would be a good sign, then?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Hm. I think you&rsquo;d know if there was a good sign, too.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;So&hellip; nothing is a neutral sign. A nothing sign. Means nothing at
                    all?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Morv was inscrutable. Obliviously naive one moment,
                    frustratingly secretive and
                    thoughtful the next. Like a baby dragon&rsquo;s eyes, containing cold rocks and scorching fire at
                    the same time. And so much smoke nothing could be clear.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I guess&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just look out for signs, then?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yes. Look out very carefully.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I thought you said I would know.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Well, not if you&rsquo;re not looking.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure about this?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Florida. Cindy.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I thought of Lola, and Mom. &ldquo;Never been surer in my life. Never been
                    surer
                    of anything.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Morv&rsquo;s expression did not change. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; they
                    said. &ldquo;Sleep well.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;And you.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Dreams had always been rare for me, or at least if I dreamed I never remembered
                    what I had dreamed
                    about, if I remembered that I dreamt at all.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But that night I was thrust into so vibrant a dream that not only did I not
                    question its reality, but
                    when I awoke in the morning, I was still convinced that everything that had occurred in my dream was
                    real. For a few long minutes I lay in the double bed in the back of Ruby which I had, for as long as
                    I could remember, shared with Mom, and wondered where she was.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dream began like this: I was driving Ruby, and beside me, instead of Morv
                    and
                    Cindy, sat my mother. It was like things were back to normal. Except
                    something&nbsp;was&nbsp;different&mdash;I saw, out of the corner of the rearview mirror, that Mom
                    was pregnant. And her face was strange&mdash;rippling like a wave. A vibration cast across her skin
                    like it was a pool of previously standing water.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; I said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Ae?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;&rdquo; I couldn&apos;t get the question
                    out.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Yes, Ae?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; She turned away from me and opened the window. Cold air
                    rushed
                    in, and highway fumes. &ldquo;Drive faster, Ae.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">I slowly pressed the accelerator.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t think you can.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to drive fast. I&nbsp;can, but I don&rsquo;t want
                    to.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;That was the right answer.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Like always, I sensed that Mom was testing me before she revealed that she was.
                    Like every conversation had some deeper purpose lurking inside it.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Can you tell me a story?&rdquo; I asked, gently relieving my
                    foot&rsquo;s
                    pressure on the accelerator and recalibrating my pace to match the traffic&rsquo;s.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;I&nbsp;can, but I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Mom parroted back at
                    me.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; I said.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">She frowned, and then began.</p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">There was once a young dragon who had lived in a small cave all their life.
                    They had never known
                    other dragons even existed, but they did not miss what they never knew. They befriended animals
                    instead. They breathed small fires onto the floor of their cave and curled around them for warmth in
                    the winter. They had long and profound meditations upon life which brought them meaning and
                    joy.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">They even painted with crushed berries onto their cave walls, and foraged for
                    seeds to replant and
                    bring more plants to life into their corner of the forest. They only knew contentment.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">Then, one day, a crop of plants which the dragon had fostered began to flourish
                    so
                    immensely that they spread beyond the small area in which this dragon lived and thrived. After a
                    time the dragon did not even know how far this clever plant stretched. The dragon had no reason to
                    believe that the spread of this plant was a problem, however; never had the dragon encountered a
                    real problem before. So they continued to live their life as they had.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But this plant was in fact an invasive species, and it began to take over
                    another
                    part of the forest into which this dragon had never set foot. There were other dragons which lived
                    in that part of the forest, and this plant killed their plants, came into their caves and spread
                    nastily up their walls, suffocating the local berries and smothering the hidey-holes of the
                    hedgehogs and squirrels.&nbsp;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dragons of this region of the forest were outraged and fearful, not knowing
                    where this plant had come from nor why. But they gathered their courage and numbers and began to
                    follow the path this plant had taken. Eventually they made it all the way to the cave of the young
                    dragon who knew no other dragons.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">At first this dragon was terrified to see other dragons, having never seen them
                    before, and, naturally, fearing anything which is unknown. But then, remembering that they had never
                    had cause to fear anything before, their fear vanished, and they faced the strange dragon with a
                    full heart and a proud chest.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; the dragons said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;been
                    planting this invasive crop.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;been the cause of our suffering.&rdquo;</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But the young dragon had never heard words before, and all they understood was
                    the
                    wind.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">They smiled, and opened their arms for a welcoming hug, just as they hugged
                    their
                    animal friends, even the hedgehogs and the porcupines.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dragons interpreted this smile as a wicked smile, and this offer of a hug
                    as a
                    threat. They all lurched backward in fear&mdash;and then remembered their weapons and raised them
                    high.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">The dragon turned around, reaching for a basket of berries, thinking to offer
                    them
                    to their guests if a hug was not preferable.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-left">But naivete is only useful sometimes. Maybe the dragons could have seen the
                    berries and interpreted it as a peace offering, but in the dark of the cave, they only saw their foe
                    turning into the darkness and reaching for an unknown object. So they descended, killed the young
